    <h>Karolis, A Poem To You, From Yours Truly, Zac Holland</h>
    <div>
        <p>
            Zac Jack Lesley Holland, bold and bright,
            Found in Karolis a love that feels so right.
            Through days of laughter, nights of stars above,
            Their bond is steady, built on endless love.
        </p>

    </div>
    <div>
        <p>In every word, in every gentle glance,
            They share a story, a perfect dance.
            Like rivers meeting, flowing side by side,
            Zac holds Karolis with a heart open wide.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <p> Through every challenge, through every storm,
        Together they rise, together they warm.
        For in Karolis, Zac’s heart found its song,
        A love so true, where they both belong.</p>
    </div>
<div>
    <p>
        So here’s to their bond, so pure and true,
Zac Jack loves Karolis in all that they do.
A tale of devotion, of joy, and of trust,
A love that will last, forever, it must.
